  "content": "Today was one of those days where everything felt like it was falling apart. I woke up late, missed my morning coffee, and then got stuck in traffic for an hour. But when I finally got to work, Sarah surprised me with a birthday cake she made from scratch. The whole team sang happy birthday, and for a moment, all the stress just melted away. Sometimes it's the small gestures that remind you how lucky you are to have people who care. I feel grateful tonight, even though the day started rough.",
